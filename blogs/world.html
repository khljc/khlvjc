    <h1>Life on this world</h1>
    <p>In the grand scheme of things, none of it matters at all, does it? What's the meaning of existence on this insignificant planet pertaining to the infinite universe? Emptiness fills most of the universe as well as our hearts, day and night, we wrestle with it. A longing for something more is present within us, nevertheless, this feeling never leaves us in spite of our efforts. This world is abundant in lustful pleasures such as drugs, alcohol, pornography, materialism, gambling, and so much more, yet, the yearning of the heart seems to stretch far beyond the edge of the universe. </p>
